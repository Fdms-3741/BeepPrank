# Beep prank

In a target (debian 11) machine, do make install as root. It will enable and start a service that will keep listening on the port chosen and wait for a secret code to arrive.

If that code is sent, the program executes a beep script. It can be either the beep program itself or a shell script that contains a music done by beep commands. Search it yourself, I've put two examples there.

## OBVIOUSLY THIS IS STUPID DANGEROUS
## DO THE PRANK AND ERASE IT FROM THE SYSTEM
